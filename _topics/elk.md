The ELK stack is an acronym used to describe a collection of three open-source projects â€“ Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana.

Elasticsearch is a full-text search and analytics engine. Logstash is a log aggregator that collects and processes data from multiple sources, converts, and ships it to various destinations, such as Elasticsearch. And finally, Kibana provides a user interface, allowing users to visualize, query, and analyze their data via graphs and charts.
